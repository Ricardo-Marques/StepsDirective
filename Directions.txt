Warnings:

The labels are positioned absolutely, so make sure they're not overflowing onto the div below.	Adding some padding to the bottom of the container fixes it. (I didn't add it because it depends on the size of font you're using).

Make sure you set position relative or absolute on my-steps or the bar will behave weird.


Usage:

This is the markup - "sequential" being defined means that the circles behind the active one also remain active. 
					 "bar" being defined means that you'll get a bar connecting the circles


	<my-steps active-step="{{ ctrl.activeStep }}" sequential bar> // {{ctrl.activeStep}} can be any variable you want. The first step will have number 1, not 0.
		<div class="step-container"> // call this whatever you'd like
			<step><span>Step 1</span></step>
			<step><span>Step 2</span></step>
			<step><span>Step 3</span></step>
			<step><span>Step 4</span></step>
		</div>
	</my-steps>


	CSS RULES---------------------

	MANDATORY --------------------

		my-steps{
			position:relative;
		}

		.circles{
			display:flex;
			justify-content:space-between;
			position:relative;
		}

		.circle{
			background:#EEE; // optional
			z-index:2;
			position:relative;
		}

		.bar{
			background:#EEE; // optional 
			z-index:1; // leave this
		}

	---------// END MANDATORY ------
		
	//Whatever color you put in here will be the color of labels that aren't active
	step{
		padding-top:10px; // optional
		color:#DDD; //optional
	}

	//Self explanatory
	step.active{
		color:#444; // optional
	}

	//This will help keep consistency
	step span{
		white-space: nowrap; //optional
	}

	//This defines the styles on the circle filling, when it's the current step (active)
	//If you don't want filling just delete these rules
	.circle.active:before{
		content:'';
		position:absolute;
		top:5px;
		left:5px;
		bottom:5px;
		right:5px;
		border-radius:50%;
